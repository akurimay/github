## Why Git and GitHub?

## A Brief History of Version Control

Git was originally created in 2005 as a way to manage the distributed development of the open source operating system Linux. The version control tool made it easy for multiple developers to work on the same code at the same time without stepping on each other's toes or overwriting existing work. If you wanted to work on the project, you could download the Linux source code, make desired changes, and then upload your version of the code base back to the main repository. It also included tools for merging the work of many developers. One of its primary functions, though, is version control--any collaborator on a project can view the version history of each file in the repo. Like Microsoft Word's "Track Changes" feature, the changes made in each file are marked by git and associated with a user across the entire project.

Hosting services for Git repositories sprouted shortly thereafter--Google Code, Sourceforge, Bitbucket, to name a few--and Github was created in 2008 as an independent alternative to existing repository services. It quickly became the most popular open source repository service, a place where software developers can collaborate, launch new projects, and share their work. It was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.

We'll be using markdown to create a syllabus, and then using Git to track any changes we make to it. Markdown allows us to format textual features like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a plain text file using a streamlined set of notations that humans can interpret without much training. Markdown files usually have a .md extension.

In markdown, we insert headings with a single hash mark like this:

# My Syllabus Heading
A sub-heading (H2) heading uses two hash marks like this:

## Readings
To provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:

*This text will appear italicized.*
**This text will appear bold.**
For emphasis, you need to mark where it should start and where it should end, so you need astrisks at the beginning and end of whatever text is being emphasized.

To create a bulleted list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:

- Reading one
- Reading two
- Reading three
To create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. Don't put a space between them:

I teach at [The Graduate Center, CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu).
Paragraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:

This is a paragraph in markdown. It's separated from the paragraph below with a blank line. If you know HTML, it's kind of like the <p> tag. That means that there is a little space before and after the paragraph when it is rendered.

This is a second paragraph in markdown, which I'll use to tell you what I like about markdown. I like markdown because it looks pretty good, if minimal, whether you're looking at the rendered or unrendered version. It's like tidy HTML.

Try using these five elements—headings, emphasis, lists, links, and paragraphs—to create a syllabus. Have a main heading that gives the course title (one #), then subheadings for, at least, course info and readings. Use emphasis (*) for book titles and try to get a list in there somewhere.

You can look at an example syllabus in raw text form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/syllabus.md). When it's rendered by GitHub, it looks like this.
